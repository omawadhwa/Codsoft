# Data Science Projects

This repository contains three key projects showcasing skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, machine learning modeling, and evaluation. The projects are as follows:

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers. We performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to understand the factors affecting survival rates. We used logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest classifiers, evaluated their performance, and fine-tuned the models to improve accuracy.

### Key Highlights:
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and categorical data
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful information
- Comparison of multiple machine learning models
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 2. Sales Prediction

The Sales Prediction project focuses on predicting the sales of a product based on advertising spending across multiple channels, including TV, radio, and newspapers. We conducted an exploratory data analysis to identify trends and relationships, followed by feature selection to determine the most significant predictors of sales.

### Key Highlights:
- Data cleaning and exploration to understand the dataset
- Feature selection to identify the impact of advertising channels on sales
- Linear regression model to predict sales
- Evaluation of the model using metrics like R-squared, RMSE, and MAE

## 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from credit card data. Given the class imbalance inherent in fraud detection, we employed techniques like SMOTE for oversampling the minority class. We experimented with various classification algorithms including logistic regression, random forests, and evaluated them using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

### Key Highlights:
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Preprocessing and normalization of transaction data
- Implementation of logistic regression and random forest classifiers
- Evaluation using confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and ROC AUC

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning and data preprocessing
- Imbalanced-learn for handling class imbalance

## Installation

Details on how to install the necessary libraries and run each project are included in their respective directories.

## Usage

Each project directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## Conclusion

These projects demonstrate a comprehensive approach to tackling real-world data science problems from preprocessing to model evaluation. Through these projects, we have showcased the ability to derive insights from data and predict outcomes using machine learning techniques.
